# Shroom Hunters

## What is it?
A full-stack rails 5 app that explores mushroom hunting and wild foraging. A user may contribute to the database by adding information about individual mushrooms that they find in the wild. 
A user may also purchase products from the store, and sign up for courses that the site-owner leads.

## Why did you make it?
My most ambitious app. I built everything from scratch here except for User authentication, that is heavy lifting that I, smartyl, leave to devise. The e-commerce front is completely built from the ground up. 
My desire to build this app came from finding no real good centralized community for wild-foragers. I plan to continue modifying this site and one day launching as a true application as opposed to a Rails study project.

## How can I use it?
-Clone the repo, cd into the directory and run bundle install.
-You'll need to set up Postgresql on your machine, I recommend following this tutorial(linux): https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-postgresql-with-your-ruby-on-rails-application-on-ubuntu-14-04
-Update config/database.yml with your user and password for postgres
-run commands 'rails db:create' and 'rails db:migrate'
